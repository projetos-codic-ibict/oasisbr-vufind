      <ol>
        <li>Click on the 'Draw Search Box' button.</li>
        <li>Click and drag to create the search box over the area of the map you wish to search.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="text-secondary">Interacting with the search results</h2>
      <p>Search results are displayed on the map as clusters (circular icons with numbers). The numbers represent
        the number of records in each cluster. A list of results is displayed below the map view. </p>
      <p>You can interact with the map by zooming by either using the zoom buttons (+/-) or by using the mouse to
        double-click (zoom in) or shift + double-click (zoom out). You can also click on a cluster to zoom to
        the features in that cluster. </p>
      <p>Clusters will de-aggregate as you zoom in or click on a cluster. Icons with rounded tops are point features.
        Icons with square tops are the center point of a rectangle feature. Click on the icon to see the record title
        associated with the icon. If there are multiple icons associated with the same record, they will all be highlighted
        in blue. Each title is hyperlinked to the associated record. Click on the title to view the full record.</p>
